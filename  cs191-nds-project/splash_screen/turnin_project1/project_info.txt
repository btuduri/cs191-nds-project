Project Members:
Ben Osborn
Brian Weiner

Project Codename:
Minimashers

Here's what each of use has done:
We both worked on a basic design which is on paper and in our google wiki (which you'd need a google account to access)
Ben did most of the structure code and Brian did the screen selection code (i.e creating clickable buttons on the screen).
Ben also created the graphics and sprites.
